<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I have 10 years of technical writing experience, and my main interest is API and developer documentation. In addition, I’ve been active in web development for about 
		3 years. I acquired my engineering skills building and refining documentation websites at work. I also watch YouTube videos, take Udemy classes, and tinker with 
		cool-looking websites. I’m scrappy, self-taught, and ambitious, and I bring that attitude to all my roles. </p>
	<p>I care deeply about creating a great user experience in my documentation. Sometimes this means writing great content, other times it means user testing, and sometimes I build UI elements.</p>
	<p>I created my website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I use Github Pages to host it. I built my website to organize my writing samples, and showcase my (current) web development skills.
